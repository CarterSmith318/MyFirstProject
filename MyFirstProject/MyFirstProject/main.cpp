/*
	Carter Smith
	C++ 2023
	Due: September 15, 2023
	Lab 1

	This lab will serve as a demonstration of your ability to download a project from
	GitHub, compile and run the project, upload a project to GitHub, and submit a project to Canvas.
	This lab assumes you have downloaded and installed an IDE (integrated development
	environment) and have also installed GitHub Desktop. If you have not met the assumptions for
	the lab, the steps you need to complete the lab may vary from what is here. The goals are for
	you to download a project, compile and run that project, and to upload your own project. If you
	meet the goals, you will get the points for this lab. Follow the directions in this lab and complete
	the tasks.
